# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:
# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]
# This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}") to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 grid, each on a new line.

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# Now it looks a bit more like the coordinates of a real map:
line1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
line2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
line3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [line1, line2, line3]
print("Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.")
position = input("Enter the position: ")

letter = position[0].lower()
abc = ["a", "b", "c"]
letter_index = abc.index(letter)
number_index = int(position[1]) - 1
map[number_index][letter_index] = "X"
print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}")
